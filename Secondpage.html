				<p>I'm Yanran Huang, visual storyteller. Currently I'm a MU journalism student in Convergence Photojournalism.</p>

				<p>"When you see the moment, you lose the moment."</p>

				<p>It's the best description for many photographers and visual storytellers like me when we are involving in a story. </p>

        <p>I always keep it in my mind and remind myself again and again. Pursuing the decisive moment and catching it are important to journalism.</p>

				<p>I took this picture during the spring break when I traveled to Ohio.</p>

				<p>The man was walking across the famous Fountain Square in Cincinnati, Ohio at late night. He just grabed some fast food and was ready to leave.</p>

				<p>I liked the lighting from both the arrounding street lights and stores' lights. The view of his back was delighted and the picture does show the hurry. </p>
